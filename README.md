# EyeDoctor

Eye Doctor is a healthcare proof of concept(POC) designed for automated eye disease recognition using digital image processing and machine learning techniques such as deep convolution neural network (DCNN). 

This initiative is aimed at building an integrated approach of facial scan using webcam along with facial image upload for eye region detection and classification of cataract eyes from regular ones using convolutional neural networks.

Technologies used:

1. Flask – Front end web based application

2. OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifier – Eye region detection

3. CNN model –Disease Classification(Cataract vs Regular eye)
